Malaria Diagnosis Using CNNs

Project Overview

This is an ongoing deep learning project aimed at diagnosing malaria using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to classify cell images into infected and uninfected categories, aiding automated malaria detection.

Objectives

Model Development: Build CNN models using Sequential API, Functional API, and Model Subclassing.

Performance Evaluation: Use Precision, Recall, Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curves.

Optimization: Improve performance using callbacks, learning rate scheduling, and checkpointing.

Data Augmentation: Apply tf.image, Keras layers, Mixup, Cutmix, and Albumentations.

Advanced TensorFlow Topics: Implement custom loss functions, custom metrics, and custom training loops.

MLOps & Experiment Tracking: Use TensorBoard and Weights & Biases (WandB).

Dataset

The project uses the Malaria Cell Images Dataset, containing labeled parasitized and uninfected blood cell images.

Technologies Used

TensorFlow, Keras - Deep learning framework

NumPy, Pandas - Data preprocessing

Matplotlib, Seaborn - Data visualization

Albumentations, tf.image - Data augmentation

TensorBoard, Weights & Biases - Experiment tracking and visualization

Current Progress

The project is in progress, with models being trained, evaluated, and optimized as more advanced techniques are learned.
